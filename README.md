What did you learn?

This was a challenging project which to time to organize and code. As there were many part to this project, it took a while to organize the code. I did use a lot of the syntax we leant in the class, but I still feel my code isn't written the most efficient way. I think this project has helped us to learn how to break a bigger coding project into smaller components.
